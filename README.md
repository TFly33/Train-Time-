# Train-Time-

The Train Time project allows users to input: 
1. Train Name 
2. Their Destination
3. The time of the first train of the day. 
4. The frequency at which the train arrives. 

The idea is to calculate the next train arrival and the moments until that train using moment.js. The project also converts a military time format to an AM/PM. 

I also added a "clear results" button that clears the current results on the page. However the user can still bring back all of the firebase logged results by refreshing the page... that's a feature, not a bug :) 

Made using:
HTML w/ Bootstrap
CSS
JS w/ Jquery
